I finally got around to putting this old website together. Neat thing about it - powered by [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) and I can use Markdown to author my posts. It actually is a lot ~~harder than I though it would be, it took me all day~~ easier than I thought it was going to be. Much better then dealing with raw html.
